The final project for this class is a collaborative team project. Your instructor will place you into project teams. You will need to decide on roles or areas of focus. 

A TA mentor is to each team.  Your TA is the project manager.  They will help guide you with ideation, a definition of done, and time management.  They are not a team developer.  They may share coding wisdom and knowledge, but you and your team are the developers.

Your TA will create the Team’s Trello board and GitHub repository.  You will need to make sure that you have access to them and demonstrate that you know how to use them.


## Part 1: Decide on Team Roles and a Team Project

### Team Responsibilities

As a team, divide up the work and assign roles. You will have time in class to work on your project together. You will also need to find time outside of class to meet and work on your project together. **Scheduling meetings outside of class time is your responsibility.** You are responsible for meeting deadlines and final project completion as a team.

### Team Decisions

Circle up and go around your team starting with the group’s TA.

Share the following with your team:
* Introduce yourself
* What do you want to get out of this class?
* Which part of web development do you enjoy the most?
* Share your project outlines with your group

As a group, decide on which project you would like to work on.  Your TA needs to approve your idea before you start working on it.  Once approved, assign roles accordingly.  

## Part 2: Workflow

As a group, create a schedule for working on your project outside of class.  Create regular check-in or working sessions to help you maintain your project timeline.

You can meet virtually or in person, it is up to you.  

## Part 3: Teamwork

Now that you have your project and roles, create a team name.  Use the team name in your repo created by your TA.

Everyone should clone and pull down a copy of the repo before class ends.  

Your repo needs a `README.md` file. Make one. if your repo doesn't contain a `README.md` file. If one exists, then have one team member open it. 

Work together to complete the project outline in the project's `README.md`.  Fill out as much of the outline as possible, save your work and then stage it, and commit it to the repo.  

Have all team members pull down the newest version of the repo.

The `README.md` is evergreen, meaning it will change as you work on your project.  The project you plan now, may not be the exact project you present at the end of this course.  Welcome to project development.  If the path changes, update the outline.

`README.md` files provide a quick summary of your repo.  

`README.md` files are written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). That is what the `.md` stands for.  Use this Markdown [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) guide to help you create and structure your `README.md` file.

### Project Outline (Created in your repo's `README.md` file):

1. **Introductions**
   * Team members
   
1. **Overview**
   * In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project.  Use the questions below to help guide your pitch.  You do not need to answer them all.
   * Consider the following:
      * What will your application do?
      * What problem does it solve?
      * What might users find useful about it?
      * Who is your ideal user?
      * Where did your idea come from?

1. **Features**
   * Each team member should provide at least 2 features.  By the time your project is complete, each feature should have a brief description.  For right now, do your best.

1. **Technologies**
   * What languages and technologies will you use to build your application
      * If you completed LaunchCode’s Web Development course, think of all the technologies you used to complete Graded Assignment 4.
      * You are not limited to the technologies you learned in LaunchCode’s Web Development courses, either.

   You may have to explore new technologies or topics as you work on your project. You can work together to learn new technologies or work on your own to complete your assigned tasks.

1. **Project Tracker**
   * Link to your team's Trello board (Your TA will make the board).

1. **Wireframes**
   * Add these here once you learn about them in upcoming lessons.

1. **Project Presentation**
   * When you complete your final project presentation, add a link here.
