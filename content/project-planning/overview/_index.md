 ## Start Here

Liftoff is an 8-week class with two objectives:

1. Complete a significant amount of work towards a collaborative, team project.
1. Prepare for the job interview process.

Class time will be similar to LC101. You will complete prep work before each class. During class, there will be a lecture, discussion or guest speaker, and small-group activities. You will be required to work on assignments outside of class, including working on a team project.

This class varies from LC101 in that you will be required to perform a lot of **independent** work on your team project. No one is going to tell you what to build and you will not be given a list of requirements. It will be up to you to make many decisions as you build your team project. We will support and guide your team along the way, but ultimately the **success of your team project rests on you**.

## Liftoff Expectations

- Class attendance and participation
- Completion and submission of all assignments
- Visible progress on your project every week


Making a project, especially your first team project, can be a daunting task. You will have to work on your project multiple times a week outside of class, in addition to the prep work and assignments. Since you are working on a team project, you may have to schedule working time with your team outside of class.  We estimate that you will need to work **at least 20 hours each week** to make it through this course successfully.

   Schedule **at least 1 team meeting** outside of class for project work before Class 2 meets. You can decide when, where, and for how long together.  This can be virtual or in-person, your choice.
   - Creating regular meeting times and places can help set the pace for your team. 
   - If you need more together time, schedule it.  Hold each other accountable for making each meeting.
