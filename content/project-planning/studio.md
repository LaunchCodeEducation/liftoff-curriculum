## Creating Teams and User Stories

### 1. Team Project Introduction

The final project for this class is a collaborative team project.  You will be placed into project teams by your instructor.  You will need to decide on roles or areas of focus.  Each team will have a TA mentor who will help you set up your team project but is not responsible for leading your project.  

#### Your Mentor (Your TA)
In each class, you will check in with your mentor and share your progress, blockers, and questions. Your mentor is a guide and team manager.  They will help you set up your Trello board and main GitHub repository.  

#### Team Roles
As a team, divide up the work and assign roles.  You will have time in class to work on your project together.  You will also need to find time outside of class to meet and work on your project together.  Scheduling meetings outside of class time is your responsibility.  You are responsible for meeting deadlines and final project completion as a team.


### 2. Decide on Roles
Circle up and go around your team starting with the group’s mentor.
 
**Share the following with your team:**
1. Introduce yourself.
1. What do you want to get out of this class?
1. Which part of web development do you enjoy the most? 
1. Share at least one idea you have for a project for this class.

### 3. Teamwork
1. Now that you have roles within your team, create a team name.  
1. As a team, decide on your final project.  Your mentor will need to approve it before you start working on it.
1. Create a user story for each member of your team.
1. Fork your team's repo

### 4. Project Outline

Submit a high-level outline of your project in the repo's **README.md** file.

As a team, flesh out the following:

1. **Overview:**  In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an "elevator pitch" for your project.  

   > Consider the following:
   > - What will your application do?  
   > - What problem does it solve?
   > - What might users find useful about it?  
   > - Who is your idea user?  Why?
   > - Where did the idea come from?

1. **Features:** Each team member should provide at least 2 features.  Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence descriptions.

1. **Technologies:**  What languages and technologies will you use to build your application?

   For example, the Unit 2 coding-events application was created in either Java or C#, depending on which language you learned.  

   The technologies to make this application in either language would include the following:
   - Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf templates
   - C#, ASP.NET Core, MySQL, and Postman

1. **What do you need to learn:** In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. You can list this as a group, you can highlight certain teammates.  You all decide together on this.

{{% notice style="warning" title="Own Your Learning Journey"%}}
   You may have to explore new technologies or topics as you work on your project.  You can work together to learn new technologies or work on your own to complete your assigned tasks.
