## Project Planning

### User Stories

Any large project should be broken down into smaller tasks.  This is a common process in software development. How you break down and define smaller tasks has a huge impact on the success of your project.  

A **user story** is a concise well-defined description of the outcome of a task.  It specifies the who, what, and why of a given feature.

Read the following articles about user stories:

### Development Roles and Workflows

Assigning or delegating roles in a project will help improve the workflow of the project.  Roles will also prevent redundancy while increasing the rate of completion. In your groups, you will need to decide who will focus on what.

Your team will also need to consider the order to complete tasks.  Take into consideration any dependencies or requirements of each task.  To start this task what needs to come first?  What follows this task?  Who else needs this task completed?  

Your TA will set up your Trello Board.  Learn more about Trello by taking a [quick tour](https://trello.com/tour).
