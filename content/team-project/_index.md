Your final team project is one of the most essential pieces of landing a LaunchCode apprenticeship. Your team project is one of the primary ways that LaunchCode and potential employers will verify that you are job-ready, and it should be something that you’re proud to show off. So don’t skimp on the time, energy, and thought that you put into this!

Be unique, innovative, and creative. Your team project should demonstrate meaningful thought and planning. It will also show that you can build software from the ground up!

Your project should:

1. **Demonstrate marketable skills:** You have a strong foundation in at least one language that is widely used by professional developers, and the related tools and best practices. You  will apply your programming skills within a professional-grade framework or tools like ASP.NET, React, or Spring Boot.


1. **Demonstrate your ability to learn new things:** In your project, you will go beyond your initial learning to teach yourself something new. Maybe you learned Angular.js for your front-end web project, or connected to an API in your back-end Java application.  

   Don’t forget how your team learns too.  Did you discover new things together? Did you share something with the team that made your code more efficient?  Did a teammate suggest a way to handle a troublesome bug?  The ability to learn on your own is good, but the ability to learn from others and teach others is equally important. 
 
1. **Solve a problem:** When employed as a programmer, you’ll be asked to implement solutions to problems. Your capstone project should demonstrate that you are capable of identifying a problem and coming up with a software-based solution to the problem.

  Creating an app that allows a nonprofit to organize and communicate with volunteers solves a meaningful problem. _Yes!_
  
  Creating a Sudoku app to prevent boredom?.  _No_

### Project Guidelines

Regardless of the project your team tackles, you should:

* **Build an application:**  Either build it entirely as a team from scratch or add to a previously started codebase. If using existing code, you need to go well beyond what was provided or worked on by others. **You should be able to clearly articulate what you built yourself versus what was built by others**.


* **Each team member is responsible for 2-3 features.** Each feature should add a new component to your project but not be so small as to be trivial. It’s difficult to define what a significant feature is, but we’ll help you understand as you go. 

   {{% notice style="primary" title="What makes a good feature?" %}}
   Adding a new button to your web project? _Probably not significant enough._
   
   Creating a discussion forum? That’s too big. Adding user authentication?
   _Yep, that’s great!_

* **Create a presentation for your project.**  Share it on GitHub or google sites?

## Your Team’s GitHub Workflow

As a team, you will work from a **single** repo on GitHub.  The team mentor (your TA) will create this repo and the Trello board.  All other team members will need to **clone** the repo to work on it locally.  Each team member should to avoid working directly on the main branch, especially if working on a new feature.  If you are all working together, then figure out your best branching strategy.

   Remember to add comments in your code for your teammates!  
   - [The Engineer’s Guide to Writing Meaningful Code Comments](https://www.stepsize.com/blog/the-engineers-guide-to-writing-code-comments) has some great examples

   Remember to add useful commit messages so your team understands the changes you made.
   - Glance through [Git Commit Messages: Best Practices and Guidelines](https://initialcommit.com/blog/git-commit-messages-best-practices) for some ideas

With your project on GitHub, it is accessible for others to view, and will show off all of the hard work you put into it as you rack up commits!  

For providing feedback to each other, consider using [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart).  Issues are great ways to log any needed changes and allow for project improvement.
