## Welcome to Liftoff!

The two main objectives of this course:
1. Complete a significant amount of work towards a collaborative, team project.
1. Prepare for the job interview process

### Class Structure
Class delivery will be like your previous LaunchCode course delivery.  Complete your assigned Prep work before each lecture.  Lectures will consist of discussion, guest speakers, and small group activities.  You will have a lot of non-class time work working on assignments.  You will need to schedule time with your team to work on your project outside class time. **A large expectation of this class is that you will work on your project independently and with your team.**


This course will need you to perform a lot of **_independent_** work on your team project.  The decisions of what to build, how to build, and who builds what us up to your team.  Deciding when to build your assigned tasks is up to you.  We will be here to offer guidance, mentorship, and support when possible.  **Ultimately, the success of your team project rests on you.**

## Liftoff Expectations
* Attend class
* Participate in class and with your team
* Complete and submit all your assignments
* Make visible progress on your team project and assigned tasks each week

Making a project, especially your first team project, can be a daunting task.  You will have to work on your project many times a week, besides to the prep work and assignments. We strongly recommend that you and your team schedule working time outside of class.  We estimate that you will need to work **at least 20 hours each week** to make it through this course successfully.

**Schedule at least 1 team meeting outside of class each week.**  This can be in-person or virtually.  Setting regular meeting times will help set the pace of your project work and keep everyone on task.

It is strongly recommended to schedule this time weekly to help set the pace for your team.  If you need more time together, then add more.  

Make sure to hold each other accountable for attending each meeting.
