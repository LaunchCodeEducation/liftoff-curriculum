## Project Ideation Outlines

The final project of this class is a functional team project.  We need to be able to start working on our team project in the first studio.  

Create 2-3 project outlines that you will share during the studio.  Use the questions below to create the outline.  This should be a very high-level, big picture for each project idea.  The more information you provide now, the more your team can discuss during studio time.  Donâ€™t focus on the details right now, those will come later if you decide to work on this project.

**Project Outline Questions**
* What will your application do?
* What problem does it solve?
* Where did the idea come from?
* What might users find useful about it?
* How would someone use it?
* Who is your ideal user? Why?
* What do you need to learn to work on this project?
* What do you already know about creating this project?
* What part of this project would you like to work on most?
