## Project Planning and Liftoff Overview

### Welcome to Liftoff!

During this portion of your class, you will:

1. Complete a significant amount of work towards a collaborative, team project.
1. Prepare for the job interview process.

Liftoff classes will be delivered in a similar manner as your previous coding courses.  You will be assigned prep work and project work.  Class time will focus on lecture and studio time.  To make the most of this section, please keep up with prep work and project work.

Making a project, especially your first team project, can be a daunting task. You will have to work on your project multiple times a week outside of class, in addition to the prep work and assignments. Since you are working on a team project, you may have to schedule working time with your team outside of class.  We estimate that you will need to work **at least 20 hours each week** to make it through this course successfully.   

{{% notice style="note" %}}
   Schedule **at least 1 team meeting** outside of class for project work before Class 2 meets. You can decide when, where, and for how long together.  This can be virtual or in-person, your choice.
   - Creating regular meeting times and places can help set the pace for your team. 
   - If you need more together time, schedule it.  Hold each other accountable for making each meeting.
