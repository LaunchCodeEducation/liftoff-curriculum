## Project Ideas


The final outcome of this class is a functional team project.  We need to be able to start working on our team project in the first studio.  Please come to class prepared and ready to work.

1. Bring **2-3** project ideas to class.  You will share these with your team.  Once everyone has shared, you will decide which project to work on as a team.  The more ideas, the easier selection can be.

For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your TA will provide feedback and direction to help sharpen your ideas. So donâ€™t worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.



### Submitting Your Work
