## Project Idea Outlines

The final outcome of this class is a functional team project.  You need to be able to start working on our team project in the first studio.  Please come to class prepared and ready to work.

**Submit 2-3 project outlines before you meet for your class studio.**  Use the questions below to create your very high-level, big-picture outline of **_each_** project idea.  The more information you provide, the more your team will have to discuss during studio time.  

#### Project Outline Questions
- What will your application do?  
- What problem does it solve?  
- Where did the idea come from?
- What might users find useful about it?  
- How would someone use it? 
- Who is your ideal user?  Why?
- What do you need to learn to work on this project? 
- What do you already know about creating this project?
- What part of this project would you like to work on most?
